# üëã Hi, I'm Shivaraj Bhanji

I‚Äôm a Master‚Äôs student at USC with a strong academic background (GPA: 3.5), graduating in May 2026. I have over a year of experience in Software Engineering, including open-source contributions to the OpenShift ecosystem and full-stack development using Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Beyond full-stack work, I‚Äôve built scalable NLP pipelines, including a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for multi-hop question answering. I enjoy collaborating on research-driven projects and actively contribute to open-source initiatives.

I‚Äôm a strong team player who thrives in fast-paced environments, communicates clearly with stakeholders, and adapts quickly to new technologies.

## üß† Projects

### üîç Multi-Hop Question Answering with RAG + Chain of Agents  
- Built a hybrid RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex for semantic retrieval and a Chain-of-Agents reasoning module for multi-hop QnA.  
- Utilized Qdrant for vector storage and employed LLaMA-3.3 and DeepSeek-R1 for inference.  
- Achieved +30% METEOR and +9.6% BERTScore-F1 over traditional RAG.  
- [üîó GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shivarajbhanji/MULTIHOP-QA)

### üé® Artsy ‚Äì Cross-Platform Artist Explorer  
- Developed a responsive Angular + Node.js web app and a Kotlin-based Android app with search, authentication, and artist tracking features.  
- Used MongoDB Atlas for real-time sync across platforms and deployed the backend to Google Cloud App Engine.  
- [üîó GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shivarajbhanji/Artsy-demo)
